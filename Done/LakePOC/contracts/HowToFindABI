Launch the JS console on truffle, this will help you to interect with deployed contract (over Ganache or Testnet), for that you
need to proivde the --network id accordingly 

> truffle console --network development

web3 will be default enable on this console, try to check out some commands like web3.eth.accounts 
> web3.eth.accounts 

get the instance of the deployed contract using below command
> <Contract Name>.deployed().then(inst => { instance = inst })

You can now interact with your deployed contract, I had tried to execute few getter 
> instance.name.call()   // this should return the Name of the contract 
> instance.totalSupply.call() 

Get the addresss of the contract 
> instance.addresss

Now the Imp part to get ABI of the contract 
> JSON.stringify(instance.abi)

But what if we want to interect with someone else token which is deployed and we know the addresss

get the web3 instance, if using node else just get the abi and addresss and get the instance like 

var Web3 = require('web3')
var web3 = new Web3(provider)
instance = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, Contractaddresss)

instance.methods.symbol().call((err, res) => {console.log(res)})
